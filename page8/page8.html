                <p class="home_paragraph-1">&emsp;&emsp;In certain circles, the phrase “sanctity of life” is often used by groups of people who have concerns about issues such as euthanasia, birth control, capital punishment, and abortion on demand.
<br><br>
According to the Family Proclamation “We affirm the sanctity of life and of its importance in God’s eternal plan. . . . Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity”
<br><br>
Emily Dickinson once said, “To be alive—is Power. Her definition suggests that life is empowerment even if living on earth occurs with certain risks and difficulties. It also perfectly encapsulates the concept that only the born have acted against the unborn to takeaway their rights and lives.

                <h3 class="home_headline-2">Protecting Life Matters</h3>
                <p class="home_paragraph-2">&emsp;&emsp;It’s important to know that the pro-abortion groups try desperately to convince people that access to abortion is an all or nothing affair. An important distinction that needs to be made is the difference between Elective Abortions and Non-Elective Abortions.  The pro-life position is just that, to protect life.  Sadly there are certain situation where the physical safety of both the mother and the child cannot both be assured and it is prudent to protect the mothers health because she has a much higher chance of living.
<br><br>
It’s also important to know that when the fetus is confirmed by medical authorities to have severe defects that will prevent the baby from living being birth then there is no helpful reason to continue the pregnancy. In also important to note the mental health of certain expectant mothers who are pregnant due to rape or incest.
<br><br>
These are examples the cases that would be considered for an elective abortion.  However, even in these situations, much thought and counsel should proceed before a final decision should be made. These examples are only 4% of all cases of abortion in the United States. The other 96% are done for selfish reasons and have led to more African-American babies in New York being killed then born.
