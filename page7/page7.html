                <h3 class="home_headline-1">Why Fathers Matter</h3>
                <p class="home_paragraph-1">&emsp;&emsp;In our society Fatherhood has taken hit after hit. Too many fathers seen in TV, movies, and even commercials are portrayed as lazy, stupid, and self-centered on their own happiness. Sadly, several factors such as divorce rates, single-motherhood, and college drop-out rate have increased which have not helped the image of dependable men.
<br><br>
True Fatherhood should be conceptualized as parental stewardship that can link generations and defined by activities that nurture relationships in family, foster growth in children, and enable the teach proper of values over generations. Scholars have tried using various theoretical perspectives to frame relationships between fathers and their children, the definition above most closely links to the proper model of fathering as generative work according to family scholars Dollahite and Hawkins in 1998. 
<br><br>
Generative work should be defined as “Generational Work” which embraces the idea that the father–child relationship requires a committed and involved effort over a lifetime. According to the Family Proclamation “Children are entitled to birth within the bonds of matrimony, and to be reared by a father and a mother who honor marital vows with complete fidelity”. This means that our society needs its men to step up to the roles of responsibility that they can uniquely fill.

                <h3 class="home_headline-2">What Fatherhood does for Men</h3>
                <p class="home_paragraph-2">&emsp;&emsp;I never thought the idea of a Father's role to preside could mean being the arbiter of who their children spend time with.  There's a quote that says "You are the average of your three best friends", it makes sense that helping children have positive influences in their formative years is a critical part of parenting.
<br><br>
I have always believed that Traditional families are the best model to follow because of how stable that they have been throughout recorded history. However, the book “Successful Marriages and Families” pointed how serious the consequences of traditional families breaking up are. The book states that being raised by divorced or single parents negatively affects children academically, socially, and psychologically and also correlates with greater incidence of risky behaviors.
<br><br>
To father a child is more than a biological act or fulfillment of a social role. To father a child is to accept a divine calling, a moral stewardship, and a lasting commitment across generations.
