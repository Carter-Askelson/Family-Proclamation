                <p class="home_paragraph-1">&emsp;&emsp;Our Culture today is one that has made incredible progress in some areas but has regressed backwards in certain others. For example why is it that society has made it normal to believe that people who would work 60 hours weeks in an office to try to climb a social ladder would personal fulfillment.  While becoming a parent is something that will drag your life to a screeching halt?
<br><br> President Joseph F. Smith reminded us: ”To do well those things which God ordained to be the common lot of all man-kind, is the truest greatness. To be a successful father or a successful mother is greater than to be a successful general or a successful statesman. One is universal and eternal greatness, the other is ephemeral”.
<br><br> As our world becomes more and more complex, there is a greater need for problem solvers.  The only chance humanity has of getting the next Nobel prize winning inventor or war-ending peacemaker is for those people to be born in the first in the first place.

                <h3 class="home_headline-2">How Marriage helps Couples</h3>
                <p class="home_paragraph-2">&emsp;&emsp;Simply put our society believes all sorts of things which may or not be true.  A false belief that many hold is that a couple moving in together before marriage significantly helps couples get to know each other better before committing to anything too permanent. Many studies have shown that living together before marriage, (cohabitation) actually increases the risk divorce if the couple is not engaged first (Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman, 2009)
<br><br> Being married also helps individuals to look beyond their own self-centered natures and learn to become a more supportive person. Depression is on the rise as loneliness inflicts our nations day in and day out. Humans are social creatures and our built to be in family units that the ancient institution of marriage provides.
