                <h3 class="home_headline-1">Why Moms Matter</h3>
                <p class="home_paragraph-1">&emsp;&emsp;According to the influential Feminist writer Betty Friedan, important achievements in life depended on doing “work that is of real value to society—work for which, usually, our society pays.” From her point of view, the family, (including getting married and becoming a mother) is a “risky proposition” for women because the institution “ranked lowest in terms of prestige” and put an obligation on women “to subordinate their personal objectives, . . . putting the needs of others first, devoting themselves to the day-to-day well-being of other family members,” this may be “virtuous,” but doesn’t lead to power and success (Polatnik, 1983, p. 35).
<br><br>
“The critics have swung the pendulum too far.” Quoting an article from Newsweek about Feminist views on Motherhood, Elder Hafen said that they “sometimes crossed the line into outright contempt for motherhood”.
<br><br>
Throughout history, mothers have been a bulwark and stabilizing force for society.  Many countries today that have demeaned the roles that mothers play in their cultures, (such as China with their one-child policy) are now facing severe demographic issues that threaten the success of their nations.

                <h3 class="home_headline-2">What Motherhood does for Women</h3>
                <p class="home_paragraph-2">&emsp;&emsp;A survey was recently done to get a sample of the mother population in the United States. In 2005 the researchers discovered that less than half of mothers (48%) felt appreciated a majority of the time, and near 20% said they felt less valued by society when they became a mother (M. F. Erickson & Aird, 2005). <br><br>
Mothers everywhere feel that society doesn’t value the kind of self-sacrifice and work that motherhood requires. This means that many feel pressure to invest energy and time in work that are perceived to be more valued by culture as a whole.
