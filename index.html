                <p class="home_paragraph-1">&emsp;&emsp;A little over twenty-five years ago, “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” was introduced and read aloud to the world’s largest Women’s organization known as “The Relief Society” at their general meeting which was held on September 23, 1995, in Salt Lake City, Utah.
<br><br>The Document goes over a variety of topics that include: the sanctity of human life, the value that family units provide to society, the benefits that both fathers and mothers bring to the raising of children, the condemnation of abuse, the potential of humanity, and many more.
<br><br>Interestingly, most of the Western World seemed unfazed for what most of the information the document provided in 1995.  Its only within the last few years that many Government Departments and Health Organizations have been taking a serious look at immense benefits the documents provide. With divorces skyrocketing, cohabitation normalized, cases of Depression rising, and suicide rates at their highest level; many are asking what has gone wrong in our societies?
<br><br>Leaders in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encourage parents everywhere to acquire their own copy of the Family Proclamation and to compare the simple, effective, and clear language with the convoluted notions of alternative family lifestyles that are sometimes lauded by our society today. A PDF copy of the Family Proclamation can be found here: <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/36035_000_24_family.pdf">PDF Download</a>

                <p class="home_paragraph-2">&emsp;&emsp;"Due to massive demand we are happy to announce the return of Rexburg's water park.  The park was closed temporarily
                    due the restrictions that affected us all during the pandemic.  Luckily for the citizens of Rexburg, the restrictions are starting to lift.  This has
                    given the City Council the hope and optimism to annouce the park's return.  Stay tuned for more annoucements."
