                <p class="home_paragraph-1">&emsp;&emsp;A little over twenty-five years ago, “The Family: A Proclamation to the World” was introduced and read aloud to the world’s largest Women’s organization known as “The Relief Society” at their general meeting which was held on September 23, 1995, in Salt Lake City, Utah.
<br><br>The Document goes over a variety of topics that include: the sanctity of human life, the value that family units provide to society, the benefits that both fathers and mothers bring to the raising of children, the condemnation of abuse, the potential of humanity, and many more.
<br><br>Interestingly, most of the Western World seemed unfazed for what most of the information the document provided in 1995.  Its only within the last few years that many Government Departments and Health Organizations have been taking a serious look at immense benefits the documents provide. With divorces skyrocketing, cohabitation normalized, cases of Depression rising, and suicide rates at their highest level; many are asking what has gone wrong in our societies?
<br><br>Leaders in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints encourage parents everywhere to acquire their own copy of the Family Proclamation and to compare the simple, effective, and clear language with the convoluted notions of alternative family lifestyles that are sometimes lauded by our society today. A PDF copy of the Family Proclamation can be found here: <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/bc/content/shared/content/english/pdf/36035_000_24_family.pdf">PDF Download</a>

                <h3 class="home_headline-2">Why is this Document Important?</h3>
                <p class="home_paragraph-2">&emsp;&emsp;The Family Proclamation significance starts with the title, says former BYU-Idaho President Henry B. Eyring. “Three things about the title are worth our careful reflection. First, the subject: the family. Second, the audience, which is the whole world. And third, those proclaiming it are those we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators… All this means that the family must be of tremendous importance to us, that whatever the proclamation says could help anyone in the world, and that the proclamation fits the Lord’s promise when he said, ‘Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same’ (D&C 1:38).”
<br><br>“The Family: A Proclamation to the World” continues to be “a clarion call to protect and strengthen families,” according to Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he continues by calling the Family Proclamation “a stern warning in a world where declining values and misplaced priorities threaten to destroy society by undermining its basic unit” (“What Matters Most Is What Lasts Longest,” Oct. 2005 general conference).
<br><br>We at the Family Proclamation Learning Center believe that the values and recommendations stated in the proclamation are needed to be learned and practiced more today than they did in 1995 when the document was first issued.
