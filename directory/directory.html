                <p class="home_paragraph-1">&emsp;&emsp;President Spencer W. Kimball taught that “the time will come when only those who believe deeply and actively in the family will be able to preserve their families in the midst of the gathering evil around us”
<br><br> We live in a society where is very easy to offend both close friends and complete strangers.  Many would say “its great to learn these things for my own family, but why should I push my beliefs on others?” 

<br><br> My response would be that if you know what a red light at an intersection and how dangerous it is for everyone to disregard its meaning; wouldn’t it be worse if you didn’t help people who didn’t

                <h3 class="home_headline-2">Using Social Networks to spread Joy</h3>
                <p class="home_paragraph-2">&emsp;&emsp;In our day we have a greater capacity to be a positive influence on a wider swath of people than any other point of history. One of the major contributing factors to this is the advances of technology and the cultural application of Social Media.
<br><br> Using Social media to share the Family Proclamation or your own experiences of how being in a family has blessed your own life is something that this world of post-truth desperately needs.
<br><br> I believe that the Family Proclamation contains truths that will stand the test of time and any who practices its teachings live happier and fuller lives.  Not only that but people who share it with others will be a blessing and a boon to their friends, loved ones, and those they may never meet face to face.
