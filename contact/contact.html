                <p class="home_paragraph-1">&emsp;&emsp;Every single person that has ever been born on Earth has a mother and a father. To learners of the Restored Gospel, it comes to no surprise to learn the spirits that live within us were begotten no differently. In the Family Proclamation it states that: 
<br><br>“The Family is central to the creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of his children” and “in the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshiped God as their Eternal Father”. We then “accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize their divine destiny as heirs of eternal life.”
<br><br>Knowing that every single person that you pass by on the street is a part of your wider family brings many to a wider understanding of their life’s purposes on earth. I know that despite all the many things I’ve done in my life, the proudest I’ve ever made my parents was when I was helping my brothers and sisters.  I know that when it comes to our Heavenly parents, it’s no different.

                <p class="home_paragraph-2">&emsp;&emsp;In the Abrahamic Religions it was God who married Adam and Eve together while they were in the garden.  This was before they had partaken of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil.  This means that when God married Adam and Eve it was when they were immortal and their marriage was meant to be everlasting as well.
<br><br>President Spencer W. Kimball observed that this used to be widely known, “Eternal marriage was known to Adam and others of the prophets, but the knowledge was lost from the earth for many centuries” .
<br><br>Luckily, we have a loving Heavenly Father who wants us to gain the maximum amount of joy possible in our existence and has brought back the Eternal Truth of Eternal Marriage, a marriage that exists beyond the limitations of “till death do you part.”.  Couples who prepare themselves properly can enter sacred temples and be married by God’s laws the same way Adam and Even were, for all time and eternity.
