                <p class="home_paragraph-1">&emsp;&emsp;Our current society is one of momentous and active change. Broad Cultural discussions are happening in our universities and our late-night talk shows over a variety of topics that have widely seen throughout history as self-evident. Societies are now being self-reflective on what is true and what is human tradition about who we really are. Everyone wants answers and some turn to the scientific method for clarification.
<br><br>Political processes sway which research gets published in journals. According to “Successful Marriages and Families”, Political points of view can and do impact the research process in that the interpretations that are made in the data can be biased and backroom decisions will be made as to which articles get published or rejected. Not to mention the selection of the topic of research has been incredibly biased. For example, every single scientific study that has come out on the side of supporting Gender Affirming surgery on minors has been conducted by those who make money off those elective surgeries in the first place showing a massive conflict of interest.
<br><br>In studies completed by Gottman, research found that for couples with stable marriages, positive to negative interactions were 5-1, not a statistic you want to be on the other side of. What's also important to know is that according to evidence found in research from Waite & Gallagher (2000), and Wood, Goesling & Avellar (2007), married adults have lower levels of morbidity and mortality.  This means that couples are more likely to live longer and healthier than single people.

                <h3 class="home_headline-2">What can be done to help families?</h3>
                <p class="home_paragraph-2">&emsp;&emsp;Traditional families, (consisting of a male and female who are married for the purpose of raising children) are the best family model to follow because of how stable that they have been throughout recorded history. However, the book “Successful Marriages and Families” pointed how serious the consequences of traditional families breaking up are. Social Scientists have stated time and again that being raised by divorced or single parents negatively affects children academically, socially, and psychologically and also correlates with greater incidence of risky behaviors.
<br><br>Therapist Richard Stuart recommends couples engage in Caring Days where couples identify sets of loving actions they would like to receive from their partner. These actions must be specific, positive, small enough to be done on a daily basis, and not related to any recent conflict,
<br><br>It’s also important to know how critical improving these relationships between people are. While traditional media places an emphasis on Teen and Young Adult suicides, the majority of recorded suicides are committed by older single men.  These men are usually those who worked their entire lives to support themselves and others financially.  Sadly, after spending so much of their lives in the work force, they lose the sense of purpose being employed gave them. This sense of purposeless is harder to overcome for men than women who generally spend more of their lives building lasting relationships with friends and family members.
